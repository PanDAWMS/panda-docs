  version: 1.0.0
  description: "\n### Protocol: we generally require communication over HTTPS. The\
    \ server will not accept HTTP requests unless explicitly mentioned.\n\n### HTTP\
    \ methods:\n* GET: Retrieve data from the server. Parameters have to be sent **in\
    \ the URL**.\n* PUT: Update data on the server. Parameters have to be sent **in\
    \ the body** in json encoded format. When the client wants to gzip the data, the\
    \ content encoding has to be set accordingly.\n\n### Response formats: \nThe return\
    \ codes are usually specified with each API function, but in general:\n* 200:\
    \ Function called correctly and response will be `Content-type: application/json`.\
    \ This does not necessarily mean that the operation was successful, but that the\
    \ function was called correctly.     Reasons why the operation could fail are:\n\
    \    * Wrong parameters or the JSON could not be decoded.\n    * The function\
    \ was called using the wrong HTTP method (e.g. GET instead of PUT).  \n    * The\
    \ function expects authentication (certificate/token) and it was not provided.\n\
    \    * The function expects production role and it was not provided.\n    * Caught\
    \ exceptions when interacting with the database.\n    \nThe usual response dictionary\
    \ has the following format:\n```\n{ \"success\": True/False, \"message\": \"Usually\
    \ an error when there was a failure. The message can generally be ignored if the\
    \ operation was successful.\", \"data\": \"The data returned if the operation\
    \ was successful.\" }\n```\n* 403: Forbidden. The client called a forbidden function\
    \ or there was an authentication issue. The response will use `Content-type: text/plain`.\n\
    * 500: Server crashed calling the method. The response will use `Content-type:\
    \ text/plain`.\n* 503: The server is overloaded. The call did not reach PanDA\
    \ and the response comes from directly `httpd`. \n"
