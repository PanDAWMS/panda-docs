DESCRIPTION = """
### Protocol: we generally require communication over HTTPS. The server will not accept HTTP requests unless explicitly mentioned.

### HTTP methods:
* GET: Retrieve data from the server. Parameters have to be sent **in the URL**.
* PUT: Update data on the server. Parameters have to be sent **in the body** in json encoded format. When the client wants to gzip the data, the content encoding has to be set accordingly.

### Response formats: 
The return codes are usually specified with each API function, but in general:
* 200: Function called correctly and response will be `Content-type: application/json`. This does not necessarily mean that the operation was successful, but that the function was called correctly.     Reasons why the operation could fail are:
    * Wrong parameters or the JSON could not be decoded.
    * The function was called using the wrong HTTP method (e.g. GET instead of PUT).  
    * The function expects authentication (certificate/token) and it was not provided.
    * The function expects production role and it was not provided.
    * Caught exceptions when interacting with the database.
    
The usual response dictionary has the following format:
```
{ "success": True/False, "message": "Usually an error when there was a failure. The message can generally be ignored if the operation was successful.", "response": "The data returned if the operation was successful." }
```
* 403: Forbidden. The client called a forbidden function or there was an authentication issue. The response will use `Content-type: text/plain`.
* 500: Server crashed calling the method. The response will use `Content-type: text/plain`.
* 503: The server is overloaded. The call did not reach PanDA and the response comes from directly `httpd`.
